# CLEP
## _How to finish undergrad in 2 years_


[CLEP](https://clep.collegeboard.org/) is a way to get college credits by taking an exam. You will save 
- money (by not paying for tuition of that course)
- time (not spending the whole semester for that one course) 

It is powered by CollegeBoard (SAT organization)
Here are the steps
1. Watch a course to get a voucher for free CLEP
2. Register for CLEP
3. ✨Get Free Credits✨

NOTE: if you want to take CLEP immediately, refer to [step 2](https://github.com/asalamatov/clep/edit/main/README.md#1-watch-a-course-to-get-a-voucher-for-free-clep), you will pay $93.00 for CLEP registration without voucher in [step 1](https://github.com/asalamatov/clep/edit/main/README.md#1-watch-a-course-to-get-a-voucher-for-free-clep)


## 1. Watch a course to get a voucher for free CLEP

- Go to [modernstates.org](https://modernstates.org/course)
- Choose a free CLEP course you want.
- please refer to this page to see what courses can be taken: [NAU catalog](https://www.na.edu/documents/academics/catalog.pdf#page=41)
- if you are not from NAU, please ask your university. Ex. [NLU Chicago catalog](https://nl.edu/media/nledu/content-assets/documents/student-services/office-of-the-registrar/registrar-forms/CLEP-Examination-Spring-2022.pdf)
- for example: 

| CLEP | SCORE | Course Equivalency |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  American Literature | 50 | ENGL 2316 |
means if you take "CLEP American Literature Test" and score "50 points" you will get credits for "ENGL 2316" course at NAU
- Modernstates will teach you everything you need to pass CLEP test. There are video lessons, tests, and reading materials. The time of completion ranges from 1 hour to 4 months on average :)
- By the end of the course you will need to submit your progress, with all the tests 75% or more
- In 10 days you'll receive a voucher by email. This voucher is for the OFFICIAL CLEP REGISTRATION ONLY. the voucher doesn't give your credits


## 2. Register for CLEP 

- Go to [CLEP site](https://clep.collegeboard.org/)
- register for an official CLEP (with online proctoring or at testing center) with the voucher you got by email from modernstates
- add your university as a recipient, 
- _NAU students, enter NAU manually, it is not on the list of universities by default yet_
- choose your time (clep can be taken almost any day)
- to take the test you'll need a _**Windows**_ computer with a working webcam, and a mirror to show the screen.
- take CLEP, using your knowledge :)
- to pass it, you need 50% or more. (some schools may have other criteria)

## 3. ✨Get Free Credits✨
- in 10-20 days after the test the results will be mailed to your school
- you will recieve your free credits for the course you took

P.S. There are some students who get their voucher from [modernstates.org](https://modernstates.org/course), by just completing the tests, not watching video lessons. It is also possible. Moreover, some crafty students pass their official CLEP Exams with the help of ChatGPT. They register for online proctoring and take CLEP on their own computers at home. Since the computer is locked during the CLEP, they use their phones with ChatGPT to search for answers. How do they do it? They just put their phones under the webcam, so it is invisible to the camera. and by typing or taking pictures of the questions and directly feeding it into chatgpt, they easily get correct answers. However, it is dishonest, and I recommend never to do it.
